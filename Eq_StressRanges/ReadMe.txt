-  data from september 2018 to early november not collected

-  "stress ranges" need to be mutiplied by 3.5 and then young's modulus because the data collected was actually in microstrain past october 2018

-  BS bolt factors need to be taken out of each bolt to get pure strain

-  if the data set does not contain all the days in a month, the days will need to
    be verified with raw collected files, since the program just counts, and doesnt index with the file name itself

- EQ stress range concept somewhat dubious for this instrumentation and application. make sure all assumptions about fatigue testing are understood before using this data
